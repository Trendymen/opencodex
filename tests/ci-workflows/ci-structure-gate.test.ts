/**
 * `structure/` is the one directory whose entire purpose is a gate, and it was
 * the one directory the gate never saw. `structure:check` reaches CI only
 * through `tests/ci-workflows/structure-ssot.test.ts`, inside the suite the `ci`
 * path filter decides whether to run — and that filter did not list
 * `structure/**`. On #4999, a pure doc split, every expensive leg reported
 * `skipped` and the aggregate `ci` check reported success over nothing (#5001).
 *
 * It hid for so long because `structure/AGENTS.md` makes a `structure/` edit
 * almost always arrive beside a `src/` one, which the `ci` filter does match.
 * Only a pure doc change exposes it, and it took a doc reaching its size budget
 * to produce one.
