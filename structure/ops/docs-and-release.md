# Docs And Release

The activation scheduling contract is covered by `tests/codex-integration/codex-quota-auto-refresh.test.ts`, including restart recovery and bounded retries. See the [quota activation contract](../providers/openai-tiers.md#public-provider-contract).

Automatic package-tree restart holds a releasable data-plane drain until its scheduled
service-home check succeeds. A veto releases that fence; a committed shutdown uses the
permanent drain latch.

macOS shards and control use the shared fresh-process batch runner described below.
`scripts/ci/sample-macos-stall.sh` remains a standalone diagnostic helper with isolated
observer regression coverage; it is not wired into those bounded batch steps. It samples
only a single identified direct Bun child after silence and cleans up only its own
diagnostic children. Process inventories emit executable basenames; command stdout/stderr
and stack reports redact literal home/workspace prefixes before capped emission. The
catalog picker fixture retains CI-only phase boundaries.

Native steering follows [the shared WebSocket contract](../transports/streaming-health.md#experimental-native-mid-turn-steering); this surface's defaults remain unchanged.

Catalog HTTP acquisition follows the [proxy-routing contract](../catalog.md#remote-catalog-http-proxy-routing).

Refresh-lock validation covers fresh unreadable locks, descriptor-matched release, path-probe failures preserving callback outcomes, and confirmed-owner unlink error handling in `tests/codex-integration/codex-account-store.test.ts`; the [catalog contract](../catalog.md#accounts-namespaces-and-pool-rotation) explicitly does not promise atomic compare-and-delete. Cooperating lock metadata changes serialize through the existing SQLite mutation transaction; release keeps the descriptor open through identity comparison and any unlink, then closes it. Failed metadata writes remove only a matching owned path after successful coordination; unknown identity, failed probes or unavailable coordination retain the path for stale recovery. Async refresh work holds no metadata transaction.

The CLI documents explicit Windows x64 installation observation separately from updates; observation never grants installation authority. See the [read-only observation contract](../runtime.md#explicit-codex-cli-installation-observation).

`scripts/install-local.ts` restores a macOS launchd plist before loading a previously loaded
service after safe rollback. A failed stop check, package rollback, or plist restoration does not
attempt another start and leaves runtime state unknown; `--no-restart` restores only the plist.

The configuration-only [plaintext V2 contract](../subagents.md#plaintext-v2-agent-messages) is scoped to canonical ChatGPT Responses forwarding; other source-area behavior described here is unchanged. CLI installation inspection reason codes, including Windows deferral, follow the [runtime inspection contract](../runtime.md#lifecycle).

Shared parsing and streaming follow the [request-copy](../transports/byte-accounting.md#request-copy-accounting) and [stream-buffer accounting](../transports/byte-accounting.md#stream-buffer-accounting) contracts.

Human-readable connect and sync-refresh diagnostics follow the [terminal rendering contract](../runtime.md#cli-readiness-diagnostics), with regression coverage for both paths in `tests/cli/cli-connect-readiness.test.ts`.

`tests/cli/cli-config-default-show.test.ts` covers optional-show parsing, offline display and explicit-action preservation; `tests/cli/cli-config-show-client.test.ts` covers the separate read-only config annotation path:
`src/cli/config-command.ts` derives token ownership without importing the connect command or
triggering catalog, lifecycle, or ACL-hardening work.

The CLI default dashboard address follows the [management ingress bind](../runtime.md#hub-management-dashboard-address), covered by `tests/cli/cli-dispatch.test.ts`.

Native main reauthentication follows the [CLI JSON output contract](../runtime.md#native-main-reauth-json-output).

The Codex restart command follows the [CLI restart scope contract](../runtime.md#cli-codex-restart-scope).

The account reference documents the [Orca source-owned import](../codex-home.md#orca-source-owned-account-import).
Its local-only command is declared in `src/cli/capabilities.ts`, and the generated skill surface
lists its required source/registry paths and preview/apply flags. The index and domain chapters follow the [CLI reference generation contract](../cli-management.md#generated-operating-reference).

Local validation follows [the contributor test policy](../../AGENTS.md#commands): run the
suite by default, with a documented resource exception requiring focused regression tests.
`scripts/setup-hooks.ts` retires only an exact match for the old managed pre-push and
post-merge shims; custom hooks are preserved. Required current-head CI and
security review remain merge requirements.

The gate preserves legacy checklist bodies and asks the author to update the first item,
clear all four boxes and save, then wait for the bot to record that checkpoint before
validating the displayed head and ticking all four boxes again. Wording-only edits do not
re-attest. The existing bot-comment state stores a versioned pending phase, real head/base,
generation, the phase publication's server timestamp and, only after rechecking, a body digest. Invalid stored state restarts the
clearing phase; a different live head/base invalidates the checkpoint. Only an author body
edit whose live snapshot agrees and whose server timestamp is later than the stored phase checkpoint
can advance it. A new phase is first persisted without a timestamp and then finalized with
the first write's server time; unfinished finalization cannot advance readiness. Hygiene
updates to the outer comment do not move this fence. Equal-second saves require a later
body edit. While re-attestation is pending, the quality check fails explicitly and defers
ordinary quality evaluation; it does not report a green gate. Before ready, the gate re-reads the PR and persisted attestation. These reads do
not make GitHub's later ready mutation atomic with concurrent edits or pushes.

## Public docs

The provider configuration reference and provider guide own the public Google tool-schema policy:
the persisted values/default, initial refusal, non-direct repair withholding, direct no-repair
behavior, and content-free diagnostics. English and all translated copies change together.

The public documentation site lives in `docs-site/` and is built with Astro + Starlight. English is
served at the site root, with French under `/fr`, Korean under `/ko`, Simplified Chinese under `/zh-cn`, Traditional Chinese under `/zh-tw`, Russian under `/ru`, Japanese under `/ja`, and Turkish under `/tr`. `docs-site/astro.config.mjs` is the locale source of truth.

Internal links are checked in two places. `docs-site/src/integrations/internal-links.mjs` runs inside the
Astro build, so the CI `docs` job and Deploy Docs both refuse a site whose generated HTML carries an
internal href or src naming a file the build did not produce, or a fragment the target page lacks. It sees
only generated HTML: client-rendered links and other hosts are outside it. `tests/ci-workflows/docs-link-targets.test.ts`
checks the docs URLs hard-coded in README files, `src/`, `gui/src/`, `skills/` and issue templates against the
content tree, without fragments, and only on pull requests that start the Bun suite.

Server-configuration credential rows in English and every locale copy distinguish data-plane `apiKeys` from the independent management admin credential and link the matching locale management reference. Credential setup instructions themselves stay in the management reference; the rows only name the separation.

Proxy-format, adapter, and provider documentation distinguishes server-level SOCKS5 configured outbound fetch from scheme-specific HTTP(S) routing, and every locale copy carrying that claim stays aligned. The public pages own the runtime detail rather than duplicating it here.

Manual navigation is defined in `docs-site/astro.config.mjs`. When adding a public page, update the
sidebar and either add localized copies or intentionally accept Starlight fallback behavior.

Provider preset totals are recounted from the current registry when a preset lands. The
documented split is 102 total: 84 key-based, 14 OAuth, three local, and one default
ChatGPT-forward preset. The English provider guide, all seven translated copies, and all eight
quickstarts carry the same counts.

That recount is no longer a manual obligation. Seventeen places restate these numbers and sixteen
of them drifted once already — the English guide reached 95 while every translation and every
quickstart, the English one included, still said 94. Both numbers read as plausible, so nothing
caught it. `tests/ci-workflows/docs-provider-preset-counts.test.ts` now derives the total and the
key-based split from `PROVIDER_REGISTRY` and asserts them against each page, so the next preset
fails every locale at once instead of drifting. Each page is located by a locale-specific phrase
rather than by its number, so rewording a sentence fails the check and asks to be re-anchored.

The fixed-host discovery limits are the same shape one layer down, and this document used to
assert their parity in prose: it claimed the guides carried the same limits, across sixteen-plus
files, verified by nobody. That claim was false when it was written — the Korean guide had no
Featherless section at all, so it documented twelve of the thirteen limited presets.
`tests/ci-workflows/docs-provider-discovery-limits.test.ts` replaces the claim with the check:
each section's byte and row ceilings are read from that preset's `modelDiscovery` and asserted
against every shipped guide, and a grouped section must first agree in the registry before one
sentence may describe both presets. Sections are located by brand name and the presence of a
`KiB`/`MiB` token rather than by a translated phrase, because a restated anchor is the same
hand-copied value the guard exists to remove; a section that is missing or duplicated fails by
name. The byte ceiling is compared as an exact token set, so a stale number left beside the
current one fails instead of passing on a substring.

Native retirement keeps active model/quota instructions aligned across locales with the
[catalog contract](../catalog.md#shared-catalog). Historical records and other providers
sharing a model-name fragment remain distinct from current Codex-native support.

The Remote Hub guide distinguishes selected-runtime readiness from general runtime diagnostics;
`tests/cli/cli-connect-readiness.test.ts` exercises that boundary and general status's single discovery pass with isolated executable fixtures.

The provider guide's OrcaRouter login section in English and all seven translated sources follows
the [bounded ingestion contract](../transports/inventory.md#bounded-response-ingestion-and-orcarouter-login):
64 KiB of valid UTF-8 JSON and one 30-second deadline covering headers and body. These are login
limits, so the public guide does not apply them to inference payloads.

## GitHub Pages

`.github/workflows/deploy-docs.yml` publishes the docs to:

```text
https://opencodex.me/
```

The workflow runs on `main` pushes touching `docs-site/**` or the workflow itself, builds
`docs-site`, uploads the artifact, and deploys with GitHub Pages.

That workflow is the deploy path, not a review gate: it first runs after promotion to `main`,
so on its own it can only report a broken site once the change has already left review. The
pull-request gate is the `docs-site-build` job in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, selected by the
`changes` job's `docs` filter (`docs-site/**` and the workflow itself). One Linux leg installs
`docs-site` with `--frozen-lockfile` and runs the Astro build, so a manifest and lockfile that
disagree fail before the build does. The `ci` aggregate treats it exactly like the other scoped
jobs: requested when the filter is true, required `skipped` otherwise.

The deliberate omission is that `docs-site/**` is not in the `ci` filter. A prose edit has no
business starting the cross-platform suite; it only has to build.

> Decision record: [ADR-0080](../decisions/ADR-0080-github-pages.md)

Local validation:

```bash
cd docs-site
bun install --frozen-lockfile
bun run build
```

## Container deployment recipe

The repository ships a root multi-stage `Dockerfile`, `compose.yaml`, narrow `.dockerignore`, and
container bootstrap helper, but still publishes no registry image. The source build pins the Bun
base by multi-platform digest, runs non-root with a read-only root filesystem and dropped
capabilities, publishes the data port on host loopback by default (remote binding is an explicit
`OPENCODEX_BIND_ADDRESS` opt-in), persists `OPENCODEX_HOME`, and streams the initial data token through stdin into the
owner-only canonical token file. A build-only manifest stage uses Git metadata from a read-only
context mount to run `scripts/generate-compatibility-version.ts`; remote Git contexts retain that
metadata through `BUILDKIT_CONTEXT_KEEP_GIT_DIR=1`. A verified host-generated artifact remains a
compatible input. No `COPY` includes `.git`, and the Git executable does not reach the runtime stage.
`docker/verify-compatibility.ts` compares all file hashes and the complete source inventory in the
read-only build context before source copy and again in the copied runtime tree. It rejects symlinks,
missing/mismatched entries, and extra source files.
The required roots are `package.json`, `bun.lock`, and `scripts/model-metadata.source.json`;
the context also admits the canonical generator, while the runtime includes only the metadata source.
Operators must still prove liveness, readiness, authenticated
catalog access, and a real routed response before promotion.

An official image would create a larger release surface requiring maintained base-image digest
updates, vulnerability scanning, SBOM, signing, registry provenance, rollback, and support policy.
Those controls still have no owner, so there is no image-publish workflow or official registry tag.

## Windows service wrapper and incomplete updates

The scheduler wrapper retries child exits, including zero, after five seconds. Only the
opt-in CLI stay-out code ends it successfully; missing Bun/CLI paths still exit with
installation error 3. Explicit service stop terminates the wrapper itself.
Before launching, the wrapper applies the bundled-Bun size gate (`REAL_BUN_MIN_BYTES`). An
in-place npm install extracts `bun/bin/bun.exe` as a small placeholder and replaces it only when
bun's postinstall runs later; executing the placeholder exits 216 and, interactively, raises a
modal 16-bit dialog. A Bun file below the gate, or one whose size cannot be read because it
vanished after the exist check, logs `bundled Bun is not ready` and is re-checked every five
seconds without being executed, so the service starts once the postinstall lands. A Bun path
that is already missing at the exist check keeps the unchanged `bun_missing` path: backup
restore, then installation error 3. If the postinstall never runs (scripts blocked), the
wrapper keeps waiting and logging; reinstalling with `--allow-scripts=bun` (or running the
package's `bun/install.js`) is the recovery, and the next pass starts without a service repair.
Timestamp expansion in the scheduler wrapper stays outside parenthesized batch
blocks so locale dates containing parentheses cannot abort prelaunch checks or
transactional-backup recovery. Delayed expansion stays disabled to preserve
exclamation marks in paths. Recovery logs a fixed success message without expanding
the filesystem-derived backup directory name into a command.
`src/service/windows-wrapper-exit.ts` defines the opt-in contract: new wrappers set
`OCX_WINDOWS_WRAPPER_PROTOCOL=1`, and all three CLI live-owner exits return 42 in that
service context. The wrapper translates 42 into a successful exit; legacy service
contexts retain exit 0.

## GitHub workflow map

The PR-target resolver accepts commit-index candidates only when their base repository's
owner and name match the workflow repository. Foreign or incomplete fork-network entries
cannot supply a write-job PR number. If no unique local current-head candidate remains,
the existing repository-scoped open-PR lookup runs; absent or ambiguous matches emit no identity.

| Workflow | Trigger | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `.github/workflows/ci.yml` | Any `pull_request`; runtime/package `push` to `main`/`preview`; manual dispatch | A pull request verifies Linux and TypeScript: Linux runs four suite shards plus `gates` alongside the scoped docs, structure, packaging, keyring, and npm-global jobs. The `platform-macos` macOS suite, the `widget` macOS widget + Tauri app-bundle build, and the `desktop-shell` Rust toolchain build are native-gated: they run on `main`/`preview` pushes and manual dispatch, and on a pull request only when the `changes` job's native path filter selects the change. `dev` pushes start nothing; dev integration is covered by the pull-request run, while `main` and `preview` must stay push triggers because `release.yml` requires a push-event run for the exact release SHA. Windows runs nine shards only on manual dispatch with `lane=all` (or empty), not on push events. Linux runs at-most-12-file processes with a 120-second process bound; Windows uses measured six-file/480-second processes and all-file scope so its full-suite contract is unchanged. The dedicated Windows batch step sets `OCX_TEST_NO_QUEUE=1` because its sequential processes are one logical runner; each process still creates an isolated home and arms the test guards before the lock boundary. No lane retries: a test failure, a process timeout and a Bun runtime crash each fail their job on the first occurrence. Aggregate `ci` is event-aware — it derives which jobs this event requested and requires `success` from each of them and `skipped` from the rest, and on a `lane=all` dispatch it reads the run's own job list and requires nine concrete successful `windows N/9` results. `npm-global-smoke` remains GitHub-hosted because it mutates the global package prefix. Manual `lane=release-gates` keeps the ordinary native-gated jobs and selected dynamic keyring/packaging matrix legs, but skips the Windows suite and unsharded macOS control. Default `all` (or empty) still requests both diagnostics; `macos-control` requests the control without Windows suite shards. Release eligibility requires successful push-event CI on the exact release SHA; a manual lane does not authorize publishing. Changes that touch only `.github/actions/` or `native/remote-workspace-helper/` run the narrow `setup-action` and `remote-helper` jobs instead of the full matrix, and Linux shard membership follows the per-file durations in `scripts/ci/test-durations.tsv`. |
| `.github/workflows/dev-version-bump.yml` | Manual dispatch with an intended version and `pre-move` or `repair` mode | Opens the reviewed pull request that moves `dev` past a release target. The default `pre-move` mode runs before promotion and publication; explicit `repair` mode retains the post-publish catch-up path. It is neither called by `release.yml` nor triggered by publication. |
| `.github/workflows/release.yml` | Manual dispatch only | npm publish/dry-run workflow. The `preflight` job checks channel, version sources, tag, GitHub release, npm, global tag ordering and the `dev` pre-move before any packaging job starts. The publish job repeats those checks, requires a successful push-event Cross-platform CI run for the exact `GITHUB_SHA` (a pull-request run does not qualify), requires `dev` to outrank the target, then checks the target against the freshly fetched global tag set before publish or dry-run. After a real publish, `release-outcomes` reports the public GitHub release, the npm version read-back and the npm dist-tag as separate rows. |
| `.github/workflows/deploy-docs.yml` | `push` to `main` touching `docs-site/**` or the workflow, or manual dispatch | Build and publish the Astro/Starlight docs site to GitHub Pages. This is the deploy path; the pull-request build gate is the `docs-site-build` job in `ci.yml`. |
| `.github/workflows/service-lifecycle.yml` | `pull_request` to `main`/`dev` and `push` to `main`/`preview`, both filtered on the service path set (`src/service.ts`, `src/cli.ts`, `src/cli/index.ts`, `src/lib/bun-runtime.ts`, `package.json`, `bun.lock`, the workflow), or manual dispatch | Service-lifecycle smoke on three platforms: Linux systemd, macOS launchd, and Windows Scheduled Tasks. Each installs, verifies, stops via `ocx stop`, and uninstalls. The path list is kept in sync with the `release.yml` service-gate regex. |
| `.github/workflows/enforce-pr-target.yml` | `pull_request_target` (opened, reopened, edited, labeled, unlabeled, ready_for_review, synchronize) plus default-branch `status` events filtered to successful `CodeRabbit` statuses | The `enforce-target` gate: rejects pull requests whose head ancestry sits on the `main` tip while far behind `dev`, rejects empty or malformed descriptions, requires a GUI screenshot when the title/body mentions `gui` (immediately waivable with the maintainer-controlled `gui-screenshot-waived` label; legacy maintainer comments remain compatibility evidence on later PR events), keeps contributor PRs in draft until a four-box readiness checklist is complete, verifies the CI / latest-dev / Codex+CodeRabbit-findings claims (review threads plus current-head CodeRabbit review-body findings outside the diff range), and adds a `review-ready` status label at the ready moment. CodeRabbit status SHAs must resolve to exactly one open current-head PR before writes. Stacked child PRs targeting another open PR's head skip the wrong-base gate. |
| `.github/workflows/enforce-issue-quality.yml` | `issues` (opened, edited, reopened), `issue_comment` (created, edited), or manual dispatch with an issue number | Issue-template compliance gate. |
| `.github/workflows/issue-quality-tests.yml` | `pull_request` and `push` to `main`/`preview` filtered on the issue/PR automation scripts, templates, and their workflows | Tests the issue and PR automation scripts themselves, so the gates cannot rot silently. |
| `.github/workflows/issue-triage.yml` | `issues` (opened) | Duplicate detection and triage labeling for new issues. |
| `.github/workflows/pr-labeler.yml` | `pull_request_target` (opened, edited, synchronize, labeled, unlabeled) | Type and path labeling plus title sync; `labeled`/`unlabeled` let a human override enqueue a fresher run in the per-PR concurrency group. |
| `.github/workflows/react-doctor.yml` | `pull_request` (opened, synchronize, reopened, ready_for_review) and `push` to `main`; no path filter | React-focused static review. Findings fail the job; write-scoped outputs stay disabled, a contract pinned by `tests/ci-workflows/ci-workflows.test.ts`. |
| `.github/workflows/stale-needs-info.yml` | `schedule` only (daily 06:15 UTC); deliberately no manual dispatch | Closes issues left in needs-info past the grace period. Manual dispatch is omitted so a branch-selected run cannot execute that branch's body with issue write scope. |

`pull_request_target`, `issues`, and `schedule` workflows always load from the repository default
branch, not from `dev`. Landing a change to one of them on `dev` does not change live behavior until
it is promoted, so those files follow the promotion model rather than ordinary integration.

`scripts/test.ts` owns `SERIAL_FULL_SUITE_FILES`, the shared process-isolation roster. Local
full-suite runs, both macOS paths, and `scripts/ci/run-bun-test-batches.sh` execute those files
alone with fresh process homes, including launchd repair and standalone home/lease cases. Hosted batches assign shard membership by the per-file durations
in `scripts/ci/test-durations.tsv` (sorted round-robin when nothing is recorded), run each shard's
files in sorted order and split only process boundaries; every selected file still runs once.
Ordinary macOS shards select 1/2 and 2/2 from the full file list; macOS control selects 1/1. Both
execute sequential batches of at most 12 files with one worker.
Storage-policy and API-usage families run as singletons, as do manifest-declared files.
This preserves full test membership but does not claim cross-batch shared-process coverage.
Every primary assertion failure, timeout or crash fails the run; diagnostic singleton
attribution never turns a failed primary green. Each control batch has a 300-second process
bound plus 15 seconds for forced reap, inside unchanged 20-minute shard and 75-minute control job caps. Other batch
lanes keep their existing defaults; optional parallelism must be a positive integer.

The Windows selector is an operational stability control, not a security boundary. A pull request
controls the `pull_request` workflow body and can rewrite an event-name check, repository variable,
or selector output. Because this is a public user-owned repository and runner groups are unavailable,
the repository setting **Fork pull request workflows from outside collaborators: Require approval
for all outside collaborators** (`all_external_contributors`) must remain enabled before any self-
hosted runner is registered. Maintainers must inspect workflow changes before approving an external
run. If that setting cannot be verified, unset `OCX_SELF_HOSTED_WINDOWS` and deregister the runner;
the workflow then fails back to `windows-latest` rather than exposing a persistent maintainer host.

Docs-only changes intentionally route through the docs workflow instead of the runtime CI gate. If a
docs change also edits runtime/package/release files, run the relevant local runtime checks before
push and let `ci.yml` provide the Linux/Windows confirmation. Service-related changes
(`src/service.ts`, `src/cli/index.ts`, and the rest of the service path set) additionally trigger the
`service-lifecycle.yml` smoke test on all three platforms.

## Root README

The root READMEs are the concise product entrypoint. They should explain what opencodex does, how to
install/start it, where Codex state is touched, and where the full docs live. Deep implementation
invariants belong in `structure/`, not the README.

## Historical docs

The upstream root `docs/` folder is retired. This Fork retains its sync policy in
`docs/fork-sync-automation.md` and Superpowers plans and specs under
`docs/superpowers/`; other retired notes remain readable in git history. New investigations and
general plans go to `devlog/`; formal Superpowers plans and specs stay under `docs/superpowers/`.
The GUI design-system contract lives in `gui/design-system/`.
When an investigation graduates into a maintained invariant, summarize it here under `structure/`
and link public workflows from `docs-site/`.

Pull-request screenshot evidence stays out of the `dev` tree by rule. Authors attach images through
the description editor or commit them to the orphan `pr-assets` branch and link them by commit SHA;
a "Protect pr-assets" ruleset blocks deletion and force-push there so pinned links stay valid. No
workflow's `push` trigger matches that branch. `tests/ci-workflows/repo-hygiene.test.ts` rejects
other files under `docs/`, the three retired evidence folders, and five loose `assets/` images.
An image committed anywhere else is caught by review, not by a gate.

Cross-cutting structure contracts are maintained by editing `structure/manifest.json`, the authority
statement, and any dependent whose local explanation changes. Regenerate `structure/INDEX.md` with
the owning command and require the structure check in hosted CI. The
[structure rules](../AGENTS.md#the-source-to-doc-map) retain review of every document mapped to a
changed source area even when no text edit is needed.

## Branch and devlog policy

[`AGENTS.md`](../../AGENTS.md) and [`MAINTAINERS.md`](../../MAINTAINERS.md) are authoritative; this section
exists so the repository-shape source of truth does not omit the shape of its own history.

- `dev` is the single integration branch and the target for ordinary pull requests. `main` moves only
  by maintainer-controlled promotion; `preview` carries the `x.y.z-preview.*` train. One documented
  exception: a stacked child PR may target another **open** PR's head branch as a review workflow, and
  is retargeted to `dev` once the parent lands or closes.
- Bun-native TypeScript on `dev` is the only runtime line. The former Go native-runtime experiment is
  retired and archived, and no `go/` tree is tracked in this repository; a local `go/` directory is
  untracked leftovers. If native code returns, the expectation is an incremental module landing on
  `dev`, not a second full-runtime branch.
- `devlog/` is a tracked directory in this repository — no submodule, no private mirror. Open units
  live in `devlog/_plan/`, closed units in `devlog/_fin/`, and external parity references in
  `devlog/_chase/` (the reference clones themselves are gitignored).
- The runtime does not consume `devlog/`, so a contributor who ignores it still builds and runs.
  Repository checks do read it deliberately: `privacy:scan` scans it, and
  `tests/ci-workflows/repo-hygiene.test.ts` enforces the mechanical guards — no tracked `160000` gitlink anywhere,
  devlog Markdown tracked as ordinary blobs, no `.gitmodules`, and no open plan carrying an unresolved
  security verdict on a security-boundary topic. Some unit-scoped release gate scripts resolve their
  evidence directory from `devlog/_plan` or `_fin` as well.
- Security work in progress does not go in any tracked directory. Scratch space only; only the
  published outcome — the fix, its regression test, the release note, the advisory once public —
  reaches the repository.

## Maintenance governance

`MAINTAINERS.md` is the source of truth for current project roles and the review and merge policy.
`.github/CODEOWNERS` declares default reviewers and repeats ownership for authentication, repository
automation, release, and governance paths where an explicit security review is required. GitHub
repository settings remain the source of truth for actual account permissions and protected-branch
enforcement. For `dev`, a current maintainer with live `maintain` or `admin` access can
explicitly integrate a PR without a second maintainer approval. The optional merge-review
helper validates this actor/base exception separately from its default contributor-approval
path; it does not certify CI or security review. The PR-only bypass leaves direct pushes,
force-pushes and deletion blocked. `main` and `preview` retain their existing review rules.

A new dashboard management operation ships with its `ocx` command in the same change, declared in
`src/cli/capabilities.ts`, or with an explicit note that it is visual-only (theme, language,
navigation). CLI commands call the running management API rather than re-implementing its validation,
so the management route stays the single domain schema.

> Decision record: [ADR-0083](../decisions/ADR-0083-maintenance-governance.md)

## Package runtime (bundled Bun)

The source runs on Bun, but the published package does **not** require a user-installed Bun.
`package.json` `bin` points at `bin/ocx.mjs` (a Node shim), and the Bun runtime ships as the `bun`
npm dependency (esbuild-style: a tiny main package plus platform-specific `@oven/bun-*`
`optionalDependencies`, finalized by the dependency's own `postinstall: node install.js`).

Invariants:

- `bin/ocx.mjs` resolves the bundled binary via `require.resolve("bun/package.json")` and a size gate
  (`>= 1 MB`) that rejects the ~450-byte placeholder stub left by `--ignore-scripts`/pnpm; it then
  lazy-runs `install.js` and execs `src/cli/index.ts` under Bun, propagating exit code and signal.
  The Windows service wrapper applies the same gate before each launch and waits on a placeholder
  instead of executing it ([Windows service wrapper](#windows-service-wrapper-and-incomplete-updates)).
- `package.json` carries `"trustedDependencies": ["bun"]` so `bun install` runs the dependency's
  postinstall, and `"engines": { "node": ">=18" }` (Bun is no longer a user prerequisite).
- The plain-Node launcher owns `OPENCODEX_BUN_PATH` selection before Bun can load project dotenv and
  stamps the chosen source/path pair. `src/service.ts` and `src/codex/shim.ts` bake that already-
  selected executable (normally the bundled binary, stable under the npm global prefix) into
  launchd/systemd/Task Scheduler and the Codex autostart shim. Bun-side code never re-selects a
  durable executable from the post-dotenv environment.
- Public docs (root READMEs + `docs-site` installation pages, all locales) state Node 18+ as the only
  prerequisite. Do not reintroduce "install Bun first" / "bun must be on PATH" guidance for npm users.

### Package-tree integrity fence

Installed npm, bun, and pnpm packages bind each server process to the package manifest identity
observed at startup. Replacing that manifest under a live process fences `/healthz`, `/readyz`, and
`/v1/*` with `package_tree_changed`. The first observed replacement starts an unref'd five-second
stability timer; if the same new manifest identity remains readable and distinct, the timer enters the existing
drain-and-restart handoff without waiting for another request. A temporarily unreadable manifest
is polled until readable and then receives a fresh full stability interval, while a return to the
startup identity cancels the pending restart. The replacement spawns `process.execPath`, which an in-place npm install leaves as the `bun` package's small placeholder until its postinstall runs, so while that path fails the `REAL_BUN_MIN_BYTES` gate the restart waits the same way and then debounces afresh; meanwhile `installedVersion` stays unreported, so a manual restart is refused as unsettled. Failed restart admission retries after the same
bounded delay. Stopping the server before the accepted restart begins vetoes it, and a service child
restarts only while it still owns the service home. Source checkouts and standalone binaries remain outside this fence.

mise installs every version in its own directory and repoints a floating link, so `mise upgrade`
never changes the manifest the fence watches: the proxy would keep serving the old version, and once
mise pruned it the fence would report the tree unreadable and refuse traffic without restarting.
`src/update/mise-launcher-target.ts` therefore plans a launcher watch, and
`src/lib/package-tree-retarget.ts` runs it, only for the managed Linux service
(`OCX_SERVICE_MANAGED=1`) of a verified mise owner whose recorded launcher is that tool's
`<selector>/node_modules/.bin/ocx`, and only when that launcher resolves to the running package at
boot. Shims, other layouts, launchd (which pins package paths) and foreground proxies are not
followed. The watch re-resolves the launcher on its own unref'd timer, so an idle service notices an
upgrade without a request. One complete target identity, canonical package root plus manifest
identity, must hold for the settle interval; a change to either, an unresolvable target, a target
outside the tool root, or a return to the running root restarts the wait. It then enters the same
restart handler as the fence without fencing requests, retries a refused admission after another
full interval, and reports the settled target's version as `installedVersion` when the fence has
none. The replacement boots from the target, so it never restarts again.

The fence withholds readiness, never identity (INV-FENCE-01). The fenced `/healthz` still answers a
local attestation challenge and reports `restartCapability`, plus the `installedVersion` on disk
once the replacement has held for the full stability interval (a readable manifest alone does not
mean the install finished).
Liveness accepts that 503 only when a caller opts in (`ocx restart`, `ocx stop`, service stop) and
only after this home's runtime record names the same pid and port and the listener proves that
record's secret; the pid in the body is never trusted alone. Ensure, update health and replacement
waits stay opted out. A fenced restart compares the CLI with `installedVersion`, because the in-place
respawn runs the replaced files at the same path, and refuses while that version is unreadable.
